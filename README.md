UK Bank Customers Report - Power BI Dashboard
 I developed this comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer demographics and financial data for a UK-based bank. The dashboard provides actionable insights across multiple dimensions, including:
-Customer Distribution by Region: Visual breakdown of customer count and account balances across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
-Quarterly Customer Trends: Identifies growth in customer acquisition over Q1 to Q4.
-Balance Analysis: Detailed views of total balance segmented by region, job classification, and gender.
-Demographic Insights: Average balances and age comparisons by gender and age groups.
-Job Classification Breakdown: Analysis of customers by job type (White Collar, Blue Collar, Other) and associated metrics like average age and balance.
ðŸ“Š The report leverages interactive slicers for real-time filtering by region, gender, age group, job classification, and quarter. This allows stakeholders to drill down into key segments for targeted decision-making and strategic planning.
This project highlights my ability to turn raw data into visually compelling and business-relevant intelligence using Power BI, focusing on clarity, usability, and data storytelling.
